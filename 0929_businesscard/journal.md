# Leaps in the Design Process
## Use of X-Form Paper Popup
This was initially applied to a different design (the rock garden in p.1), giving it dimensionality and interactivity. I explored several variations: from V-folds to 3-piece floored designs, as well as the origami twist (p.2). Ultimately, I settled on the X-Form for its simplicity and flexibility in adding more layers.

## Cutouts to Share Information Between Foldable Layers
I realised that making the card foldable could make it effectively double-sided while only being able to engrave on one side. Combined with the requirement to add a cut-through element in the card, this became an obvious inclusion.

## Flipping the Attaching Side of the Slider
The mechanism used for the moving fish was originally designed to only complete its motion when the page is opened to a full 180 deg. For my pop-up card with 90 deg motion, the full range is therefore not possible. The graph of opening angle to motion angle in this mechanism is not a straight diagonal line. After plotting a rough estimate (p.3), I decided to move the mechanism to one of the pop-ups and the horizontal pop-up bar. This gave the mechanism more motion.

# Changes in Final Design
I kept the X-Form pop-up structure from the first card as it received positive feedback, but augmented it by adding an additional moving piece. Though the mechanism functions, it deteriorates quicklyâ€”perhaps the card stock is too weak at its current width.
Per some other feedback, I also changed the name cutout to match the theme of the rest of the card. Finally, some laser cutter parameters were also modified to make the engraving on the borders of the fish cleaner.

# The Design Process: A Funnel?
The process was indeed somewhat of a funnel: starting with several different ideas for cards (incorporating several different interests), then selecting some to refine then ultimately settling on a design. In particular, I believe that it was refining multiple ideas from the initial 10 that gives it the funnel shape, as save the final idea, the others were not iterated on as many times, yielding the slope shape of the funnel's sides. In the second phase following feedback, could perhaps be thought of as a second funnel following the first, as the idea range did expand before further refinement.
